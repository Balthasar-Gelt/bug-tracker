# Bug Tracker
**URL:** bug-tracker.sk

You can use one of the existing accounts listed below that already have pre-generated content or you can create your own account.
After log in you will see the main list of all projects that the user have access to. Some projects may have green background. That means that the project has been created by the logged user. Only project owners can delete or edit the project. You can create a new project by hitting the green Add button.
Users can log out or change their setting by hovering over their user icon near the top right corner.
To see all the bugs of each individual project all you have to do is to click on the project name in the project list or the bug icon.
Bugs are assigned to stages. To create a bug the project must have at least one stage. Only project owners are allowed to create bugs.
